# MySQL broker

A pairing exercise with a London tech consultancy to create a MySQL service broker that conforms to the [Service Broker API](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/services/api.html) of Cloud Foundry.

This exercise was started from scratch without preparation. We test drove a basic Sinatra app using RSpec and Guard, and implemented the fetch catalog response: `GET /v2/catalog`.
